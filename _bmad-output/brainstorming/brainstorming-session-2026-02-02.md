# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** martinus
**Date:** 2026-02-02

## Session Overview

**Topic:** AI-powered shopping assistant with algorithm-driven discovery and privacy-first user data storage

**Goals:** Explore product features, technical architecture, user experience, business model, and success metrics for a privacy-respecting AI shopping recommendation system

### Session Setup

**Core Vision:** Build an AI shopping assistant that intelligently discovers products matching user interests while maintaining strict data privacy—user data encrypted and accessible only to the AI, never exposed to other users or third parties.

**Key Differentiator:** Privacy + Smart Recommendations = Trust

**Approach Selected:** AI-Recommended Techniques - Customized technique suggestions based on session goals

## Technique Selection

**Recommended AI-Analyzed Techniques:**

1. **Question Storming** (Phase 1: Foundation) - Define the right questions about privacy-first shopping AI, user needs, algorithm challenges, and trust-building mechanisms
2. **SCAMPER Method** (Phase 2: Generation) - Systematically explore features, algorithms, architecture, and business model through substitute, combine, adapt, modify, eliminate, and reverse lenses
3. **Assumption Reversal** (Phase 3: Strategic Depth) - Flip core tensions between discovery algorithms and privacy protection to find breakthrough insights

**AI Rationale:** Your vision requires balancing intelligent recommendation algorithms with privacy-first architecture. Question Storming ensures we ask critical questions before solving. SCAMPER provides systematic exploration across all dimensions of your product. Assumption Reversal unlocks your unique competitive advantage by solving the central tension of privacy + personalization.

**Total Estimated Time:** 50-60 minutes
**Session Focus:** Comprehensive exploration of features, algorithms, privacy architecture, and strategic differentiation
